# SmartHydrponik
The Smarthydrophonic project aims to simplify the monitoring of hydroponic plants in the greenhouse of Masjid Jami YARSI for 
mosque administrators. This application enables users to oversee hydroponic plants remotely through notifications on the 
application, eliminating the need for regular physical checks.
